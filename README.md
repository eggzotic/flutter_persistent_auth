# flutter_stateless_persistent

The original "flutter create" app re-written entirely with Stateless Widgets, using Provider to hold the app-state data. And now, also including:
- persistent storage for the app state, via Google Cloud Firestore
- data-sharing, for the state data - run simultaneously in multiple simulators/emulators/devices to see real-time data-sharing

## Getting Started

This project is the third in a series starting from the default Flutter starter app, converting to all-Stateless Widgets, and now adding persistent & shared data via Google Cloud Firestore. The repo for the previous edition is at https://github.com/eggzotic/flutter_persistent_local
